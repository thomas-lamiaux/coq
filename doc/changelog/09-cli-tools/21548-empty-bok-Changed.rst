- **Changed:**
  `rocq compile` does not create empty `.vos` and `.vok` files anymore,
  their creation is left to the makefile generated by `rocq makefile`.
  Other build system may choose to create these empty files at their discretion
  (`#21548 <https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/pull/21548>`_,
  by Gaëtan Gilbert).
