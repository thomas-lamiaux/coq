- **Changed:**
  The ``-compat`` :ref:`command line option <command-line-options>`
  now raises a warning rather than an error when the compatibility file
  doesn't exist. This enables easier use of the compat mechanism with
  versions where the compatibility file doesn't exist yet
  (`#19370 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/19370>`_,
  by Pierre Roux).
