- **Added:**
  :cmd:`Print Universes` `Subgraph` accepts raw universe names (which end in an integer instead of an identifier)
  for debugging purposes, eg `Print Universes Subgraph ("foo.1" "foo.2")`.
  The integer in raw universe expressions is extremely unstable,
  so raw universe expressions should not be used outside debugging sessions
