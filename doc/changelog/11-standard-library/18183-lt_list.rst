  well-founded list extension ``list_ext`` of a well-founded relation in ``Coq.Wellfounded.List_Extension``, including infrastructure lemmas.
  It can be used for well-foundedness proofs such as ``wf_lex_exp`` in ``Coq.Wellfounded.Lexicographic_Exponentiation``.
  Also added lemma ``Acc_simulation`` and ``wf_simulation`` to ``Coq.Wellfounded.Inverse_Image``, and lemma ``clos_t_clos_rt`` to ``Coq.Relations.Operators_Properties``
