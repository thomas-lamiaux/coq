Command-line and graphical tools
================================

This chapter presents the command-line tools that users will need to
build their Rocq project, the documentation of the CoqIDE graphical
user interface and the documentation of the parallel proof processing
feature that is supported by CoqIDE and several other GUIs.
A list of available user interfaces to interact with Rocq is available
on the `Coq website <https://coq.inria.fr/user-interfaces.html>`_.
