Displays the differences between successive proof steps in coqtop and CoqIDE.
Proof General requires minor changes to make the diffs visible, but this code
shouldn't break the existing version of PG.  See pp_diff.ml for details on how
the diff works.

Diffs are computed for the hypotheses and conclusion of each goal in the new
proof with its matching goal in the old proof.

Diffs can be enabled in coqtop with 'Set Diffs "on"|"off"|"removed"' or
'-diffs on|off|removed' on the OS command line.  In CoqIDE, they can be enabled
from the View menu.  The "on" option shows only the new item with added text,
while "removed" shows each modified item twice--once with the old value showing
removed text and once with the new value showing added text.

In CoqIDE, colors and highlights can be set in the Edit/Preferences/Tags panel.
For coqtop, these can be set through the COQ_COLORS environment variable.

Limitations/Possible enhancements:

- coqtop colors were chosen for white text on a black background.  They're
not the greatest.  I didn't want to change the existing green highlight.
Suggestions welcome.

- coqtop underlines removed text because (per Wikipedia) the ANSI escape code
for strikeout is not commonly supported (it didn't work on my system).  CoqIDE
uses strikeout on removed text.

(* Diff the old and new hypotheses.  The RHS (starting at ":" or ":=") is diffed with
   the same token-based diff used for goal conclusions.  Identifiers in the LHS are
   handled differently:

   The order and grouping of LHS identifiers in the added/unchanged lines is always
   the same as when diff is not enabled.  Identifiers existing in the old context
   that are present in the new context with the same RHS are not highlighted.  New
   identifiers are always highlighted.

   If all the existing identifiers in a line have a new RHS, those identifiers are
   not highlighted (in this case, the RHS will be highlighted, making the change clear).

   Removed and added lines are generated in separate passes.  Removed lines appear
   before the added line that has most identifiers in common with the old.  (For
   a tie, use the first one found.  For zero in common, put the removal before
   the first addition/common line.)  This should be a good but not perfect
   approximation to what a human might do.
