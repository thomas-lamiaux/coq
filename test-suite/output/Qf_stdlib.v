(* async proofs off because the output order ends up different with
   and without async *)

(* Example from coq-lsp: we need to test 3 methods where the quickfix
  can come from for the Coq -> Stdlib transition:

  - Coq appearing in require (tested in line 2 of code)
  - Coq appearing in identifiers (tested in Check and Line 1)
  - Coq being looked up via nametab (tested in About)
*)
Require Import Coq.ssr.ssrbool.
From Coq Require Import ssreflect ssrbool.

(* Note: this tests the two different lookup modes *)
