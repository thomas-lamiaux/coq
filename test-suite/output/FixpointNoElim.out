The command has indeed failed with message:
Recursive definition of bar is ill-formed.
Cannot define a fixpoint
with principal argument living in sort "Type@{α3 ; Set}"
to produce a value in sort "Set"
because "Type@{α3 ; Set}" does not eliminate to "Set".
Recursive definition is: "fun _ : foo => I".
